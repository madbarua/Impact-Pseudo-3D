Impact-Pseudo-3D
================

This plugin allows impact to render in pseudo 3D like Wolfenstein 3D. It leaves everything intact, so you can write your normal impact entities and plugins.

I included some sample entities and a sample level from my 7dfps attempt [Attack of the Gorillas](http://7dfps.org/?projects=attack-of-the-gorillas). If you want to see this plugin in action, look there.

Usage
=====

For the time being, look at the code. There are some comments on what the different variables do.

-----------

The first thing you should do, is look at the sample level provided. There you will see how the wall textures are defined. Every texture gets an id that references a part of the texture sprite.
